            Player1 starts the game by rolling the dice... <br><br>
            The score on dice (except 1) will be added to current score of Active player (Player 1 initially).<br><br>
            After rolling the dice there will be two options: <br><br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> <p class="p"> Either to hold the current score : Holding the score will add the current

                    <br>
                <li> <p class="p"> Roll the dice again : If dice score is not 1, then the active player has choice of 
                    rolling the dice again and current dice score will be added to current score. </p> </li>
